‚úÖ Logic of the Code (Step-by-Step)
üîÅ Sliding Window + Counting Zeros Approach
Purpose: Find the length of the longest subarray containing only 1s after flipping at most k zeros to 1.

Technique: Use a sliding window with two pointers (left and right) and a counter for zeros.

üß† Algorithm Breakdown (Line-by-Line Logic)
1. Initialize:
zeros = 0 ‚Üí number of zeros in the current window.

left = 0, right = 0 ‚Üí window boundaries.

maxlen = 0 ‚Üí tracks the maximum length of a valid window.

len = 0 ‚Üí current window length.

2. While right < nums.length:
Traverse the array with the right pointer.

3. If the current number is 0:
java
Copy
Edit
if (nums[right] == 0) {
    zeros++;
}
Count the zero in the window.

4. If number of zeros exceeds k:
java
Copy
Edit
if (zeros > k) {
    if (nums[left] == 0) {
        zeros--;
    }
    left++;
}
The window becomes invalid, so shrink it from the left.

If the element at left is 0, decrease the zero count.

Move left to shrink the window until zeros <= k.

5. Update current window length:
java
Copy
Edit
if (zeros <= k) {
    len = right - left + 1;
}
If the current window is valid, calculate its length.

6. Update the maximum length:
java
Copy
Edit
maxlen = Math.max(len, maxlen);
Keep track of the longest valid window found so far.

7. Move right pointer ahead:
Expand the window to include the next element.

8. Return maxlen:
This is the length of the longest subarray with at most k flipped zeros.

üß™ Edge Cases
1. Empty array
Input: [], k = 1
Output: 0

No elements to process.

2. No zeros in array
Input: [1, 1, 1, 1], k = 2
Output: 4

Already all 1s, no need to flip anything.

3. All zeros, and k is small
Input: [0, 0, 0], k = 1
Output: 1

Can flip only one 0 ‚Üí maximum one 1.

4. Zeros within 1s
Input: [1, 0, 1, 1, 0], k = 1

Best subarray after flipping one 0 ‚Üí [1, 0, 1, 1] or [1, 1, 0]
Output: 4

5. k = 0 (No flips allowed)
Input: [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]
Output: 2 (the longest sequence of 1s without any flip)

üîç Why Each Line is Important
Line	Why it's Important
if (nums[right] == 0)	Tracks how many zeros in the window
if (zeros > k)	Ensures the window doesn't exceed the allowed flips
if (nums[left] == 0) zeros--;	Correctly updates zero count while shrinking the window
left++	Shrinks the window from the left to regain validity
len = right - left + 1	Measures valid window length
maxlen = Math.max(...)	Tracks the maximum length found

‚úÖ Time and Space Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n)
Each element is visited at most twice ‚Äî once by right, once by left.

Space Complexity: O(1)
Only a few integer variables are used.
