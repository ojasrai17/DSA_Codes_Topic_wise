Ceil The Floor
Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 43.76%Submissions: 149K+Points: 2
Given an unsorted array arr[] of integers and an integer x, find the floor and ceiling of x in arr[].

Floor of x is the largest element which is smaller than or equal to x. Floor of x doesn’t exist if x is smaller than smallest element of arr[].
Ceil of x is the smallest element which is greater than or equal to x. Ceil of x doesn’t exist if x is greater than greatest element of arr[].

Return an array of integers denoting the [floor, ceil]. Return -1 for floor or ceiling if the floor or ceiling is not present.

Examples:

Input: x = 7 , arr[] = [5, 6, 8, 9, 6, 5, 5, 6]
Output: 6, 8
Explanation: Floor of 7 is 6 and ceil of 7 is 8.
class Solution {
    public int[] getFloorAndCeil(int x, int[] arr) {
        Arrays.sort(arr);
       int low=0;
       int high=arr.length-1;
       int floor=-1;
       int ceil=-1;
       while(low<=high){
           int mid=(high+low)/2;
           if(arr[mid]==x){
               return new int[]{x,x};
           }
           if(arr[mid]<x){
               floor=arr[mid];
               low=mid+1;
           }
           else{
               ceil=arr[mid];
               high=mid-1;
           }
       }
       // code here
       return new int[]{floor,ceil};
    }
}
