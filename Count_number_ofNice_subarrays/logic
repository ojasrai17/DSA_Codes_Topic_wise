ere’s a clear explanation of the logic (with bullet points and edge cases) for solving the problem:
“Count subarrays with exactly k odd numbers” using sliding window and no HashMap.

✅ Main Logic
We use the fact:

javascript
Copy
Edit
Number of subarrays with exactly k odd numbers = 
      Number of subarrays with at most k odd numbers 
    – Number of subarrays with at most (k - 1) odd numbers
✅ Why this works
atMost(k) gives all subarrays with 0 to k odd numbers.

atMost(k - 1) gives all subarrays with 0 to (k - 1) odd numbers.

Their difference gives subarrays with exactly k odd numbers.

✅ Sliding Window: atMost Function
java
Copy
Edit
while (right < nums.length) {
    if (nums[right] is odd) sum++;
    while (sum > k) {
        if (nums[left] is odd) sum--;
        left++;
    }
    count += right - left + 1;
    right++;
}
✅ Variable Meaning
Variable	Meaning
left	Start of current window
right	End of current window (expanding rightward)
sum	Number of odd numbers in current window
count	Total number of valid subarrays with at most k odds

✅ Why count += right - left + 1?
It adds all valid subarrays ending at right and starting anywhere from left to right.

That’s right - left + 1 subarrays.

✅ Example Walkthrough:
java
Copy
Edit
nums = [1, 1, 2, 1, 1], k = 3
At most 3 odd → returns 10

At most 2 odd → returns 8
✅ Final Answer: 10 - 8 = 2

These 2 subarrays with exactly 3 odds:

[1,1,2,1]

[1,2,1,1]

✅ Edge Cases
Case	Explanation
k == 0	Then countAtMost(k - 1) becomes countAtMost(-1) → should return 0. Code handles this by:
if (k < 0) return 0;	
All even numbers	No odd → all windows with 0 odds. So only atMost(0) matters.
All odd numbers	Many possible windows — atMost logic efficiently tracks it.
Empty array	Edge-safe, loop exits immediately.
